        <h2>PROLOGUE</h2>
        <h4><p>Two households, both alike in dignity,</p>
            <p>In fair Verona, where we lay our scene,</p>
            <p>From ancient grudge break to new mutiny,</p>
            <p>‘Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean.</p>
            <p>From forth the fatal loins of these two foes</p>
            <p>A pair of star-cross'd lovers take their life;</p>
            <p>Whose misadventured piteous overthrows</p>
            <p>Do with their death bury their parents’ strife.</p>
            <p>The fearful passage of their death-mark'd love,</p>
            <p>And the continuance of their parents’ rage,</p>
            <p>Which, but their children’s end, nought could remove,</p>
            <p>1s now the two hours’ traffic of our stage;</p>
            <p>The which if you with patient ears attend,</p>
            <p>What here shall miss, our toil shall strive to mend.</p>

        <h2 class = "bld">What is HTML?</h2>
        <h4><p><br><span class = "bld"> Markup Language (<span class = "dottedUnderline">HTML</span>)</span> is the standard markup language for creating web pages and web
            applications.<br/>
            
            Web browsers receive <span class = "dottedUnderline">HTML</span> documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents
            into multimedia web pages. <span class = "dottedUnderline">HTML</span>, describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally
            included cues for the appearance of the document.<br/><br/>
            
            <span class = "dottedUnderline">HTML</span> elements are the building blocks of <span class = "dottedUnderline">HTML</span> pages. With <span class = "dottedUnderline">HTML</span> constructs images and other objects
            such as interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page. <span class = "dottedUnderline">HTML</span> provides a means to create
            structured documents by denoting structural semantics fr text such as headings, paragraphs, ists links,
            quotes and other items. <span class = "dottedUnderline">HTML</span> elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets. Tags such as
            &lt;img/&gt; and &lt;input /&gt; directly introduce content into the page. Other tags such as &lt;p&gt; surround and
            provide information about document text and may include other tags a5 sub-elements. Browsers do not
            display the <span class = "dottedUnderline">HTML</span> tags, but use them to interpret the content of the page.</p></h4>

            <h2 class = "bld">Markup</h2>
            <h4>
                <p>
                    <span class = "dottedUnderline">HTML</span> markup consists of several key components, including those called fags (and theit attributes),
                    character-based data types, character references and entity references. <span class = "dottedUnderline">HTML</span> tags most commonly come in
                    pairs like &lt;h1&gt; and &lt;/h1&gt;, although some represent empty elements and so are unpaired, for example
                    &lt;img&gt;. The first tag in such a pair is the start tag, and the second is the end tag (they are also called opening
                    tags and closing tags)<br/><br/>
                    
                    Another important component is the <span class = "dottedUnderline">HTML</span> document type declaration, which triggers standards mode
                    rendering.<br/><br/>
