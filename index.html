        <h2>PROLOGUE</h2>
        <h4><p>Two households, both alike in dignity,</p>
            <p>In fair Verona, where we lay our scene,</p>
            <p>From ancient grudge break to new mutiny,</p>
            <p>‘Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean.</p>
            <p>From forth the fatal loins of these two foes</p>
            <p>A pair of star-cross'd lovers take their life;</p>
            <p>Whose misadventured piteous overthrows</p>
            <p>Do with their death bury their parents’ strife.</p>
            <p>The fearful passage of their death-mark'd love,</p>
            <p>And the continuance of their parents’ rage,</p>
            <p>Which, but their children’s end, nought could remove,</p>
            <p>1s now the two hours’ traffic of our stage;</p>
            <p>The which if you with patient ears attend,</p>
            <p>What here shall miss, our toil shall strive to mend.</p>

        <h2>What is HTML?</h2>
        <h4><p>Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language for creating web pages and web
            applications.
            
            Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents
            into multimedia web pages. HTML, describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally
            included cues for the appearance of the document.
            
            LHIML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs images and other objects
            such as interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page. HTML provides a means to create
            structured documents by denoting structural semantics fr text such as headings, paragraphs, ists links,
            quotes and other items. HTML elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets. Tags such as
            <img /> and <input /> directly introduce content into the page. Other tags such as <p> surround and
            provide information about document text and may include other tags a5 sub-elements. Browsers do not
            display the HTML tags, but use them to interpret the content of the page.</p></h4>
