        <h1>Romeo and Juliette</h1>
        <h2>ACT1</h2>
        <h2>PROLOGUE</h2>
        <h4><p>Two households, both alike in dignity,</p>
            <p>In fair Verona, where we lay our scene,</p>
            <p>From ancient grudge break to new mutiny,</p>
            <p>‘Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean.</p>
            <p>From forth the fatal loins of these two foes</p>
            <p>A pair of star-cross'd lovers take their life;</p>
            <p>Whose misadventured piteous overthrows</p>
            <p>Do with their death bury their parents’ strife.</p>
            <p>The fearful passage of their death-mark'd love,</p>
            <p>And the continuance of their parents’ rage,</p>
            <p>Which, but their children’s end, nought could remove,</p>
            <p>1s now the two hours’ traffic of our stage;</p>
            <p>The which if you with patient ears attend,</p>
            <p>What here shall miss, our toil shall strive to mend.</p>
